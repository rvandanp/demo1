I wanted to Congratulate you first and then thank you for the stellar performance and execution you showed in delivering NetAcad 3.0. This was a long 6 quarters delivery that not only included Post login but also OneID and Regional PoP that is currently under pilot in China with 2000 students. You joined us just 2 quarters back and not only quickly came up to speed but also lead the overall testing of this platform. RESULTS are speaking for themselves now that we have gone live. You lead this effort with more than 50 rounds of testing on various environments. Your team was critical in making sure the performance needs were met before we go live. Thank You!!

I still remember the day you joined us. You were curious to learn and ready to lead the team.  You took this bull from the horn and made sure every component of our platform was stress tested. Be it One ID integration Canvas Integration, Post Login Functionality, VDS Integration, Data, ETLs and everything that was created or updated in this Project. You touched every function and tested every line of code written. That’s what it takes to have a quality release and you delivered it while making it look easy. We all know it was a difficulty task. Amazing!! 

You collaborated with teams within Corporate Affairs, IT for OneID and outside. That’s what it takes to get to success like it. Thank you for joining us and making such a impact that fast. This is time to take a pause and pat yourself. Enjoy the great milestone, achievement and the glory. We are all proud of you!

The whole team and I are very impressed by your effort,  leadership and dedication. I salute you and thank you for collaboration, partnership, and hard work that bought us home.

Thank you again, 
Parminder
